# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. It involves the development of a predictive model trained on a dataset containing various customer attributes and their churn status. The goal is to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Utilizes a dataset containing 7044 entries and 21 features.
- **Predictive Model**: Implements machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression for churn prediction.
- **User Interface**: Includes a Flask-based web application with options for manual data entry and CSV file upload.
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Provides actionable insights and recommendations based on churn predictions.
